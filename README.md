Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple, lightweight, and interactive implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. This project was built to demonstrate core programming logic, including state management, win-condition algorithms, and user interface design.

🚀 Features
Two-Player Mode: Play locally with a friend.

Win/Draw Detection: Automatically detects when a player has won or if the game ends in a stalemate.

Score Tracking: (Optional) Keep track of wins for Player X and Player O.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on different screen sizes (for web versions).

Restart Functionality: Reset the board instantly to start a new round.

🛠️ Built With
Language: [e.g., Python / JavaScript / C++]

Framework/Library: [e.g., React / Pygame / None]

Styling: [e.g., CSS / Tailwind] (If applicable)

🎮 How to Play
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

Player 1 is X, Player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

Would you like me to customize this specifically for a certain programming language (like adding a package.json section for Node.js or requirements.txt for Python)?
